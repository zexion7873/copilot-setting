Do NOT use for feature requests (prefer implement), performance tuning without a concrete error (prefer performance), or known simple typos (prefer implement).'

# Debug — Workflow

Systematic isolation and minimal fix.

Full coding rules in `instructions/*.instructions.md`. Key rules:

- **SQL**: never introduce concatenation while fixing — see `instructions/sql.instructions.md`
- **Exceptions**: no empty catch blocks; don't add new swallow points — see `instructions/java.instructions.md`
- **Resources**: connection leaks are a common root cause, not just style — see `instructions/java.instructions.md`
- **Hibernate**: session lifecycle issues cause subtle bugs — see `instructions/spring-hibernate.instructions.md`

## Phase 1 — Define the Problem

```
Expected:      <what should happen>
Actual:        <what actually happens>
Error/Trace:   <exact message, not paraphrased>
Reproducible:  always / sometimes / once
Since when:    recent change / always / unknown
```

## Phase 2 — Gather Evidence

Read stack trace bottom-up — first line in YOUR code is the entry point. Check recent git changes in the affected area.

## Phase 3 — Form Hypotheses

List causes ranked by likelihood. For each: what confirms it, what refutes it, effort to verify. **Verify lowest-effort hypothesis first.**

## Phase 4 — Isolate

Binary search on execution path: entry → failure point → check midpoint → narrow until divergence is one line.

## Phase 5 — Verify Root Cause

Before fixing: does the cause explain ALL symptoms? Is this the ROOT cause or a symptom? Could the same cause affect other code?

## Phase 6 — Fix Minimally

- Fix only the root cause; do not refactor in a bugfix
- Smallest possible diff
- Search for same pattern elsewhere; log as separate findings

## Handoffs

- → `@implementer` — to implement the fix after root cause confirmed
- ← `@implementer` — when implementation reveals a deeper bug
- ← `performance` skill — when a performance issue turns out to be a bug
